# Dealing with missing values

It is assumed that the weather between the 3 NY airports are similar so any missing values for:
- wind_dir (wind direction)
- wind_speed 
- wind_gust 
- visib

Will be replaced by the average of the other airports data for that date.

## Number of passengers and passengers affected by delays

```{r}

planes <- read_csv("clean_data/planes_clean.csv")

flights %>% 
  left_join(planes, "tailnum") %>% 
  group_by(origin, is_delayed) %>% 
  summarise(max_passengers = sum(seats, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = is_delayed, values_from = max_passengers,
              names_prefix = "x") %>%

```

## Number of monthly flights 

```{r}

flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, month) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = count, colour = origin)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12)

```

Newark has the highest number of flights in NY with approximately 10,000 per
month between March and August. There is a peak in August.

## Proportion of flights which are delayed across 3 NY airports.

```{r}

flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), prop_delayed = mean(is_delayed, na.rm = TRUE))

```

Newark Airport flights are delayed 24.1 of the time whereas JFK has only 22.1%
delayed flights and La Guardia has 21.1% delayed flights. Newark has the highest
proportion of delayed flights of the 3 airports compared here but the most 
flights. So why?

## Which routes are delayed the most?

```{r}

flights %>%
  group_by(origin, dest) %>% 
  summarise(prop_delayed = mean(is_delayed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = origin, values_from = prop_delayed) %>% 
  arrange(desc(EWR)) %>% 
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% 
  select(dest, name, EWR, JFK, LGA)

```

## Average Delay Length 

```{r}

flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 0) %>% 
  summarise(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
            med_dep_delay = median(dep_delay))

```

Average departure delay at Newark is approximately 48.6mins compared to 48.6mins
at JFK (the same) and 50.7mins at LGA. However, the median delay time is quite a
bit higher at Newark at 26mins, compared to 22 and 23 for JFK and LGA, 
respectively.

## Average monthly delay time

```{r}

monthly_delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, month) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 0) %>% 
  summarise(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
            med_dep_delay = median(dep_delay),
            count = n())

monthly_delays

monthly_delays %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = avg_dep_delay, col = origin)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) +
  labs(title = "Average monthly delay duration",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Delay Duration (mins)")

# this needs to be updated to be delay = 15+ mins
monthly_delays %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = count, col = origin)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) +
  labs(title = "Monthly flight delays",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Delays")

```

The average monthly delay duration peaks in the summer in July, showing a strong
seasonal variation. However, the number of flight delays stays high from March 
to August (~4000 delayed flights per month). This tells us that despite July not
being the month with the most delays, there must be something else which is causing
the delays to be on average, longer in this month. For example, there is a
significant spike in the number of delays in December and January however the
average delay durations are at an annual low (around 43mins) compared to the
peak in July of 62 mins.

## Are there any planes which are delayed more frequently?

```{r}

flights %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(prop_delayed = mean(is_delayed, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n(),
            num_delayed = prop_delayed * n) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n), desc(prop_delayed)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = n, x = prop_delayed)) +
  geom_point()


```

```{r}
# are larger planes delayed more often?
flights %>% 
  left_join(planes, "tailnum") %>% 
  group_by(seats) %>% 
  summarise(prop_delayed = mean(is_delayed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = seats, y = prop_delayed)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

avg_wind_dir


```

Appears to be spikes in the frequency of wind direction for 310 and 40 (which
matches well with the runway angles). However, 2017 saw quite a large proportion
of wind directions heading 335 degrees. Newark runways have the biggest
difference between runway angle and wind_dir which may be a reason for the
number of delays at Newark.
